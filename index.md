<h1>Welcome to the Primate Evolution and Genomics Lab!</h1>

<br>
Our lab uses genomic data and computational methods to understand primate behavior, ecology, and evolution.
Our work involves the development of software and methods, as well as the analysis of large, population genomic
datasets. Current projects focus on a variety of taxa across the order Primates, as well as other nonprimate model systems.
