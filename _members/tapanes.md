#description: "Liz is interested in the forces and mechanisms that generate biodiversity in natural populations. She often combines museum work, lab work, computational analysis, and the sampling of wild populations. Liz is the product of Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), having received a Bacherlos of Science from Florida International University and a Master of Arts from Florida Atlantic University. As an undergraduate, she worked on studying behavior of monogamous owl monkeys. As a master's student, she studied the phenotypic consequences of hybridization on hair morphology. Due to her academic upbringing within HSIs, Liz also plays an active role in her university and within her local community to increase diversity and equity in science.

#As a PhD candidate at the George Washington University, her dissertation has focused on the ultimate and proximate mechanisms generating hair diversity in the primate clade. Through her affiliation with the PEGL lab at Utah, she is studying protein evolution at key hair genes across Indriidae lemurs and is also working on a population genomics project of diademed sifakas. Outside of the lab, Liz enjoys time off with her cat, exploring the great outdoors, cooking, dancing, and staying politically active."
