description: "
Tim was an undergraduate at Miami University (Ohio), graduating in 2008 a BA in
Anthropology and Zoology. While he was there, he worked with Linda Marchant and
Scott Suarez, both in the Department of Anthropology, on projects related to primate behavior.


After Miami, Tim spent part of 2008 as a Junior Visiting Research Fellow in the
[Leverhulme Center for Human Evolutionary Studies (LCHES)](http://www.human-evol.cam.ac.uk/) at
the University of Cambridge working with Bill McGrew. He then spent the rest of
2008 studying chimpanzees at [Semliki, Uganda](https://semliki.sitehost.iu.edu/).


Tim then moved to Connecticut to earn a Ph.D in [biological anthropology from Yale University](https://anthropology.yale.edu/).
At Yale, Tim worked with [David Watts](https://campuspress.yale.edu/ngogochimp/)
and [Brenda Bradley](https://www.gwprimategenomicslab.org/), initially studying the behavior
of chimpanzees at Ngogo, Uganda, before he ended up taking up genomics to begin
exploring questions related to speciation in primates.


After graduate school, Tim did a postdoc with [Melissa Wilson](http://www.sexchrlab.org/)
in the School of Life Sciences at Arizona State University. During this time, he worked
on a variety of genomic projects involving reptile evolution and sex chromosomes.


Starting in January, 2019, Tim became an Assistant Professor in the
[Department of Anthropology at the University of Utah](http://anthro.utah.edu).
He also currently serves as the President of the
[American Association of Anthropological Genetics](http://anthgen.org/)."
