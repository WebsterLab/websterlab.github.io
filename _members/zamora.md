description: "Andrew Zamora is a PhD candidate under Dr. Jason Kamilar at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He uses comparative genomics to investigate how genetic networks involved in the regulation of social behavior have evolved across Indriid primates and how the evolutionary history of those networks has been potentially shaped by the ecological and social environment of each species. Andrew has also studied primate socioecology, community structure, phylogenetics, functional morphometrics, and cognition in a variety of extant and extinct taxa. He's had the pleasure of studying two terrific primate species (Propithecus edwardsi and P. deckenii) in Madagascar and really misses the people he worked with and food he would eat while he was there."
