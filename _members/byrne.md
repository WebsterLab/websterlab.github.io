description: "Hazel's research interests are centred in molecular primatology and evolutionary genomics of Neotropical primates; using genetic/genomic data to probe their evolution and explore the origins and maintenance of diversity. Much of her research involves the use of molecular techniques to shed light on the evolution and speciation of Neotropical primates, some of which are strikingly understudied. This research often ties into addressing questions surrounding taxonomic classification, biogeographical history, historical demography, and adaptive evolution. Her most notable research subjects to date are the titi monkeys (subfamily Callicebinae), but she is also currently involved in projects on squirrel and capuchin monkeys. Hazel joined PEGL as a postdoc in December 2019 where she studies capuchin genomics with a focus on population demography and adaptive evolution."
